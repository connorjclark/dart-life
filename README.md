## Building

[Setup Dart](https://dart.dev/tutorials/server/get-started)

```sh
pub get
sh build.sh
cd dist
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

## Note

I made this nearly 7 years ago (2013) and subsequently never touched Dart again. In response to John Conway's passing, I dusted this off and deployed to GitHub pages. I only modified the Dart enough to allow the project to build with the latest Dart SDK (suprisingly very little needed to change). I didn't change any of the styling or color scheme, as horrid as it is.
